Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Emgineering is the the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining different types of softwares in tech.
The importance of software engineering are :
1. problem solving.
   software engineering entails  a variety of critical thinking and problem solving skills.To overcome complex challenges requires a methodical, logic based approach to identifying technical issues and improving processes. Through software engineering, you can desigh, innovate and create solutions on such complex problems.
   2. levaraging technology
      software engineering has a large virtual toolbox of technologies that makes it easy to design and innovate solutions. using critical thinking and technological expertise, a software engineer can create software systems  that drive economic and societal progress such as development methods,libraries of softwares and frameworks.
      3. global research accessibility
         many aspects of digital connectivity and inclusivity benefits gtreat time through software engineering.the increased access to the internet and mobile tech has grown the reach of digital software, making it readily available to billions of people.
         4. scalability and flexibility
            software engineering is critical in supporting business growth and innovation. as businesses grow, so do the needs of their software systems.a good software engineeer recognises the needs and therefore will design with scalability in mind, so that the systems can handle an increased load withouth affecting the performance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
1. the rise of object oriented programing(OOP)
2. the increasing prominence of cloud computing and artificial intelligence(AI) in software development
3.the emergence of high level programming languages(Fortan)
4.the development of structured programming methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning.
   this is the foundation of any successful software development project. the goals, objectives and the requirements are gathered and documented. the requirements usually are based on customer feedbackor rather the market research evaluating existing products options. planning establishes the project's directionand ensures that all participants have a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how to achieve results.
2. feasibility analysis
   once planning is complete, the feasibility analysis phase begins. the project team now evaluates whether the project is technically and financially viable by assessing the technical requirements, estimating costs and performing a risk analysis.
3. system design
this phase includes creating the software's structure and design based on the requirements gathered during planning by creating a blueprint  outlining how the software will function. 
4. implementations
   this phase is also known as the development phase. the design is beign transformed into a functional application. actual coding takes place at this stage. the developers writes codes based on the design specifications. and ensures the results is efficient, secure and maintainable.
5. testing
  this phase is critical because it generates essential performance and usability feedback while revealing defects and quirks.the main objective of this stage is to identify and fix bugs by ensuring that the software operates as intended before being deployed to users. 
6. deplpoyment
 after the tasting is complete,the solution is now deployed to end users. this typically includes a beta testingphase oe pilot launch that is limited to a selected group of real world users.
7. maintainance
this is the last phase. even after the software is deployed, ongoing support is necessary to address issues, apply updates and add new features. continuous maintainance ensures that the software remains functional and relevant over time.  
 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate
waterfall model
agile models


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Role and Responsibility of Software Project Manager
Planning Everything from Execution to Delivery.
Oversee the Software Development Team.
Delegating Work Effectively.
Monitoring Progress and Tracking Roadblocks.
Managing the Deployment Deliverables.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
